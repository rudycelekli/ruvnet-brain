/**
 * scripts/oracle/repo-recall.mjs — the BLOCKING retrieval gate for a corpus release.
 *
 * WHAT THIS REPLACES, AND WHY THAT IS A REDUCTION, NOT A PASS.
 * ADR-086's C3 asked for >= 95% Hit@5 PER REPOSITORY over N = 2 x min(100, U) questions that are
 * mechanically templated from sampled source spans. Measured against the real 4.3.25 archive it
 * returns 680/1152 = 59.0%, classified `diagnostic` / c3Eligible:false. Two hypotheses for that
 * number were tested and BOTH DISPROVED: ef_search is irrelevant (identical at 100/256/512) and the
 * labels are valid (commits match, sampled spans present in the corpus). C3 is therefore not
 * demonstrated, and nothing in this module demonstrates it.
 *
 * This gate measures a NARROWER, checkable promise: every repository in the archive answers a real
 * human question about itself out of its own content, and the labeled file keeps appearing in the
 * top 5 at no worse a rate than the last accepted release. The Astra/Astra Dual deliberation
 * (2026-09-15, cross-vendor independence ABSENT and disclosed) was explicit about the status of
 * that swap: "Legitimate as an openly acknowledged reduction and redefinition of release
 * requirements. It is instrument-shopping if presented as satisfying C3 or providing equivalent
 * evidence for the original accuracy promise." So the report this module emits carries BOTH
 * measurements, and every field is named so it cannot be read as more than it is.
 *
 * THE RATCHET IS THE TEETH. A coverage-only gate would pass an archive whose ranking had collapsed,
 * because a store returning any of its own passages still "covers" its repository. The committed
 * floor in data/repo-recall-floor.json forbids that: Hit@5 may rise freely and may never fall. A
 * candidate at 175/194 is REFUSED even with perfect coverage and a better machine-oracle score.
 *
 * Fixture: data/retrieval-query-evidence.json — 194 questions, one per repository, written before
 * this gate existed (sourceCommit 149b290c) and frozen by digest here, so the instrument cannot be
 * quietly edited to make a candidate pass.

/**

 * This was an UNCONDITIONAL clamp of 176 hits. Against the 194-store fixture it meant 90.7%; the
 * moment the fixture was legitimately re-scoped to the pinned seed's actual 182 stores, the SAME
 * constant silently became 96.7% and refused a candidate it had never measured. The comment that
 * used to sit here predicted exactly that and told a future reader to make it fixture-scoped "in
 * the same change" — which is how a gate becomes one more thing to service instead of a guard.
 *
 * Retrieval quality on the release path is already measured, through a real installed host, by
 * scripts/retrieval-canary.mjs (recallAt10 >= 0.98 over the sealed plan). A second, differently
