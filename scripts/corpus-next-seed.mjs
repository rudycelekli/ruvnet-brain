// scripts/corpus-next-seed.mjs — resolve night N+1's seed from night N's published generation.
//
// ADR-086 step 18, verbatim: "Resolve the previous compatible, verified corpus generation at runtime
// as the next seed; retain the committed exact seed as bootstrap/recovery input. Do not commit a new
// pointer every night."
//
// So this NEVER writes to the repository. It reads the published release list, picks the newest
// corpus generation that is genuinely usable as a seed, and prints a descriptor for the preparation
// workflow to consume. When nothing published qualifies — first run, an incompatible runtime, an
// unsigned or half-uploaded release — it falls back to the committed data/corpus-seed.json, which is
// the bootstrap/recovery input and is content-addressed independently.
//
// "Compatible" means THIS RUNTIME CAN CONSUME THE SEED (ADR-0091 D4). It is NOT "the generation
// shipped the same runtime version as the approved pin": that rule rejected every generation the
// moment a code release moved the approved runtime, so the seed chain reset to the weeks-stale
// bootstrap on every release (ADR-0091 section 3.4). The runtime's executables never come from a
// seed anyway -- build-bundle.mjs copies runtime modules from the checkout and only named store
// files from the seed, and verifyApprovedRuntime's backward check still refuses any unpinned
// executable in the candidate. So --pin is gone from this script entirely. What CAN make a seed
// unusable is judged here, from small files, BEFORE the ~500 MB archive is ever fetched:
//   1. the receipt (schema 3, as before) records every store's embedding model and dimensions, and
//      they must equal what this runtime's forge build produces (kb/forge-corpus.mjs
//      FORGE_BUILD_FINGERPRINT) -- vectors from another model are not searchable by this one;
//   2. the generation's detached .recall.json must be the one its receipt binds, must have been
//      measured against THIS runtime's frozen fixture digest, and must pass THIS runtime's
//      readRecallReport -- the same reader and arguments corpus-seed.yml's downstream seed
//      re-check uses, so that re-check (which has no fallback) only ever sees a generation that
//      already passed here.
// "This runtime" is --runtime-root: the source tree whose readers will consume the seed. On the
// nightly that is the approved runtime's own sourceSha (ADR-0091 D3), which usually trails main.
// It defaults to this checkout, which is right whenever the checkout IS the build source.
//
// A generation that fails any check is SKIPPED with its reason, never a failure: the walk moves to
// the next older one. At most SEARCH_BOUND (5) generations are judged, so one bad format change can
// never turn into an unbounded walk of release history; after that the committed bootstrap is used.
//
// "Verified" is decided by evidence that is checkable without downloading 500 MB here: the tag must
// be the content-addressed corpus-sha256-<digest> form, the release must not be a draft, and it must
// carry exactly one of each of ruvnet-brain.zip, its detached .sig, corpus-receipt.json and both
// detached reports, with the receipt's own archive digest equal to the digest in the tag. The full
// byte-level proof still happens downstream where the archive is actually fetched (corpus-seed.yml
// re-checks sha256 and byte length before reconciliation, corpus-reconcile.mjs checks the ledger
// schema after extraction, and corpus-candidate.mjs re-derives the whole candidate from the bytes).
//
// ADR-0091 D6: --require-coverage is the CODE-RELEASE mode (ci.yml's release-qe and warm-brain jobs,
// and release.mjs's publish-time re-check). A code release assembles single-pass from the
// generation's sealed coverage, so a generation that did not publish its coverage sidecar
// (CORPUS-COVERAGE.json + coverage-receipt.json, D6.2) -- every generation published before D6 --
// is skipped as incompatible FOR THAT PURPOSE, with its reason. It remains a valid nightly seed:
// without the flag nothing about the nightly's selection changes.
//
// Usage:
//   node scripts/corpus-next-seed.mjs --repo owner/name [--runtime-root <source tree>]
//                                     [--bootstrap data/corpus-seed.json] [--require-coverage] [--out <file>]
