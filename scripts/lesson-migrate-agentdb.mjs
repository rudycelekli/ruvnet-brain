/**
 * lesson-migrate-agentdb.mjs — ONE-TIME reconciliation: fold every `lesson-*` row from the two
 * AgentDB stores into the ONE plugin lesson store that lesson-gate.mjs actually reads
 * (~/.config/ruvnet-brain/lessons.json), losing nothing.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS ALONGSIDE plugin/scripts/lesson-bridge.mjs. The bridge already carries any
 * AgentDB row that is TAGGED with `trigger:<key>` into the store, 1:1, as `G-<slug>` (global) /
 * `P-<slug>` (project) — and running it has already merged 44 of the 91 `lesson-*` rows this repo's
 * two AgentDB stores hold (verified live 2026-09-26: the store already contains 34 `G-*` and 10 `P-*`
 * ids whose evidence cites the exact bridged key). The bridge does ONE thing on purpose and refuses
 * to guess a trigger for an untagged row (ADR-066: a keyword classifier is exactly what produced a
 * false positive once already) — and it never asks "does an EXISTING lesson already say this?", so a
 * rediscovery of the same rule under a new key becomes a duplicate row, not a merge.
 *
 * This script is the other half: for the 47 rows the bridge cannot place (13 untagged in the global
 * store, 35 in the project store — because untagged rows are the norm there, not the exception), a
 * human (this migration's author) read every one against the current 61-entry store and recorded a
 * decision — MERGE into an existing entry that already states the same rule (by MEANING, not string
 * match), or NEW where nothing in the store covers it yet. That judgment cannot be automated without
 * repeating ADR-066's mistake, so it is captured once, here, as data (MANUAL_MAP below), and the
 * script only APPLIES it — mechanically, idempotently, and never silently dropping a row it does not
 * recognise.
 *
 * READ PATH: `ruflo memory list --format json` + `ruflo memory retrieve --format json` — the CLI,
 * never raw sqlite3 (this repo's memory policy exists specifically to prevent a second, disconnected
 * read/write path from developing by accident).
 *
 * WRITE PATH: plugin/scripts/lesson-store.mjs's own `updateLessons()` — locked, atomic, backed up,
 * and refuses to shrink the store. A MERGE never rewrites an existing lesson's `statement`; it only
 * appends one evidence line (idempotent: skipped if that exact source key is already cited anywhere
 * in the target's evidence — which is also how "already bridged" rows are detected, see
 * `alreadyCites()`). A NEW lesson is created once, under an `L##` id (never `G-`/`P-` — those
 * prefixes are lesson-bridge's own and `mergeBridged()` treats them as fully OWNED, i.e. a future
 * bridge run wholesale-replaces every `G-*`/`P-*` id with what it currently recomputes from tagged
 * rows; minting new content under those prefixes would make it silently vanish the next time
 * lesson-bridge --apply runs. `L##` continues this store's own native numbering (L01-L17 already
 * exist) and is untouched by the bridge).
 *
 * COUNTS ABOVE ARE POINT-IN-TIME (verified live 2026-09-26), NOT A CONTRACT — both AgentDB stores are
 * live and grow during ordinary sessions (one new dual-homed row, lesson-blast-radius-machine-wide-
 * changes, appeared in both stores between this script's dry-run and its first --apply, mid-authoring
 * of this very file). MANUAL_MAP is therefore necessarily a snapshot too. The script does NOT trust
 * that snapshot to be exhaustive: any row it cannot place via an already-bridged id OR an exact
 * MANUAL_MAP key is a hard refusal (see `unmapped` below), never a silent skip — add a decision and
 * re-run rather than assume "not in the table" means "not real".
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/lesson-migrate-agentdb.mjs --dry-run   # prints the full mapping table, writes nothing
 *   node scripts/lesson-migrate-agentdb.mjs --apply     # merges/creates (locked, atomic, backed up)
 *   node scripts/lesson-migrate-agentdb.mjs --dry-run --json
